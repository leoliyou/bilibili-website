# bilibili-website
Bilibili is a popular Chinese video sharing platform, celebrated for its unique community-centric approach that resonates strongly with anime and gaming enthusiasts. In this project, I meticulously crafted a static replica of Bilibili's homepage from scratch. The version focuses on the visual layout, utilizing a carefully selected color scheme and structured navigation elements to accurately mimic the original site's aesthetic. The aim was to create a faithful visual representation of Bilibiliâ€™s user interface and overall user experience.
